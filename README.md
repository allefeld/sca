# Synchronization cluster analysis

From 2004â€“2007, I made several attempts at developing a method to identify and characterize clusters of partially synchronized oscillators from data. These are contained in the subdirectories:

`sca`: Synchronization Cluster Analysis (2004)

`scaE`: generalized Synchronization Cluster Analysis via eigenvalue decomposition (2007)

`scaM`: Synchronization Cluster Analysis via Markov coarse-graining (2007)
